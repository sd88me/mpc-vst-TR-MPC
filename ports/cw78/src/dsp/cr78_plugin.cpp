 * cr78_plugin.cpp — Schwung plugin_api_v2 wrapper for the CW-78 engine.

 * Runs in-process inside the shim's SPI callback (SCHED_FIFO 90). render_block
 * therefore does no allocation, no file I/O and takes no locks — all of that
 * happens in create_instance.
 *
 * Structure follows 8W8's sc808_plugin.cpp, which follows 6W6's, which
 * follows 9W9's er99_plugin.c, on purpose: the kits should feel identical
 * under the hands, so the pad map, silent-select window, per-lane mutes,
 * pad-follow is the same mechanism with a CR-78 roster.

         *   v1 followed get_beat_position() alone — which is clip-relative
         *   and can sit at -1 while the set is audibly playing — so Play was
         *   silent until the slot's clip state changed and the pattern came
         *   in "out of the blue".
         *
         *   v2 added a free-running clock for whenever bp < 0. Worse: bp is
         *   not guaranteed stable block-to-block, and every time it flapped
         *   between valid and -1 the two clocks disagreed about the current
         *   step, the != last-step guard passed on both, and the pattern
         *   MACHINE-GUNNED triggers at block rate. That is the "horrible
         *   noise" field report, verbatim.
         *
         * So: get_clock_status() is the gate — stopped means silent, full
         * stop. While RUNNING, the step comes from bp when bp is valid, and
         * from a sample counter that is RE-SYNCED TO bp on every valid block
         * — so if bp drops out mid-run the counter continues from the same
         * phase and the two sources can never disagree about the step.
