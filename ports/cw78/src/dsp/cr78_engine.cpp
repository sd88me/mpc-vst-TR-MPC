 * Kit balance.
 *
 * THIS WAS WRONG UNTIL IT WAS PUT ON HARDWARE, and the mistake is worth
 * keeping written down because it was a confident one.
 *
 * Page 30 of the service notes ends with an amplitude column — 0.4 Vpp for
 * the bass drum, 0.8 for the rim shot, 0.15 for the bongos — and this file
 * used it as the kit balance, on the grounds that it was Roland's own numbers
 * rather than someone's taste. It is not the mix. It is an ALIGNMENT SPEC:
 * page 30 tells the engineer to put a scope on the voice board and trim each
 * voice to that amplitude AT ITS OWN OUTPUT, one at a time. What reaches the
 * summing amp is that voltage through the channel's output resistor, and
 * those differ by more than two orders of magnitude — the bass drum leaves
 * through R640 at 10 k and the hi bongo through R610 at 1.5 M.
 *
 * Used as a mix it puts the kick level with sixteenth-note maracas and
 * quieter than the rim shot. On the Move that reads as a kit with no kick at
 * all: the bass drum is 62.5 Hz with 97% of its energy under 120 Hz, the
 * device's speaker gives nothing back down there, and a few dB is the
 * difference between "quiet" and "absent".
 *
 * So the balance below is a MIX, written down and defended, the way 8W8's
 * kVoicing is — in dB relative to the bass drum, which is the reference
 * because on a drum machine it has to be:
 *
 *   the rim shot and the claves are CLICKS with a high crest factor; matching
 *   their peaks to a kick's makes them scream. They sit well down.
 *
 *   the maracas play SIXTEENTHS in half the presets. At the kick's level a
 *   bossa nova is a maracas record. -13 is what lets the pattern read.
 *
 *   the toms, congas and bongos sit just under the snare, which is where a
 *   CR-78's own recordings put them.
 *
 * The factory Vpp column is kept below, unused by the balance, because it is
 * still the right thing for voice_check to hold each lane to — it is a
 * per-voice specification and it is correct as one.
