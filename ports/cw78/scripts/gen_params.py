"""Single source of truth for CW-78's parameter surface.

Emits src/dsp/cr78_params.h, which carries THREE things that must never
drift apart:

  * chain_params   — types/ranges/options the Shadow UI needs (JSON)
  * ui_pages       — the page hierarchy (JSON; served under "ui_pages" so
                     ui_chain.js loads it, see the comment in ui_chain.js)
  * the pot table  — key -> real engineering range + curve + default

from the same dict.

The generator itself is 6W6's, inherited through 8W8 (GPL-3.0) — the module
shell is deliberately identical across the kits so a control means the same
thing on all of them. What is NOT inherited is a single default: every one
below comes from the CR-78's own service notes.

# ---- MODS ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Things this module does that a CR-78 does not. They are listed here in one
# place, and each one is marked "MOD" at its site, because the whole point of
# the rest of this project is that the defaults ARE the machine — and a change
# nobody can find is how that stops being true.
#
# 1. DECAY RANGE ON THE MARACAS AND THE TAMBOURINE.
#
#    A CR-78 has ONE hi-hat, so in practice the maracas and the tambourine are
#    what you reach for when you want a second and third one. Their decay
#    ranges were drawn tight around the factory figures, which made that
#    awkward: the maracas topped out at 200 ms — plenty for its own 20 ms
#    voice, nowhere near an open hat — and the tambourine bottomed out at
#    30 ms, too long for a tick.
#
#    Both now span what the HI-HAT spans, so the three noise lanes cover the
#    same ground and can be played as a set:
#
#        hi-hat       10 ms .. 600 ms   (unchanged, factory  60 ms)
#        maracas       5 ms .. 600 ms   (was ..200 ms, factory 20 ms)
#        tambourine   13 ms .. 1.5 s    (was 30 ms.., factory 220 ms)
#
#    WHAT THIS COSTS THE DEFAULT, EXACTLY. Defaults are written here as
#    engineering values and PV() solves the pot position, so the factory
#    figure itself does not move — but the pot is 128 steps, and re-spanning
#    the range re-quantises where 20 ms and 220 ms land. Measured:
#
#        maracas     20.159 ms -> 20.170 ms   (+0.056%)
#        tambourine 222.164 ms -> 222.836 ms  (+0.303%)
#
#    Put that in proportion: one pot step on the OLD maracas range was 2.9%
#    and on the old tambourine range 3.1%. So both shifts are a small fraction
#    of a SINGLE STEP of the control — the pot could never represent 20 ms or
#    220 ms exactly in the first place, and these land no further from them
#    than they already did. The endpoints were chosen for that: 0.6 and 0.013
#    are the round values whose rounding falls closest (0.5 would have cost
#    1.6%, 0.010 on the tambourine 2.3%).
#
#    Nothing else changed — not the envelope, not the filter, not the noise
#    source, not one component value. Only how far the knob goes.
#    tools/golden_check renders every lane at defaults, the demo pattern and
#    all twenty presets and holds the lot to the bit, so any FUTURE change
#    here has to be deliberate and re-blessed.
#
# 2. A HAT CHOKE GROUP.
#
#    A CR-78 has one hi-hat and no open/closed pair, so it has nothing to
#    choke and no choke control — this module said so, at length, and it was
#    right. This is the mod that changes it, and it is a mod rather than a
#    correction: the hardware does not do this.
#
#    What makes it worth having is the decay mod above. Once the maracas can
#    ring for 600 ms and the tambourine for 13, those two plus the hi-hat are
#    a set of three noise lanes covering the same ground — which is a hat
#    section, and a hat section wants a choke.
#
#        Off     nothing chokes anything. THE DEFAULT, and bit-identical to
#                a build without this control at all.
#        MA/TB   maracas and tambourine choke each other. The hi-hat is left
#                alone, because at 60 ms it is already the short one.
#        All3    hi-hat, maracas and tambourine are one exclusive group —
#                whichever you hit last is the only one still ringing.
#
#    The choke is a 2 ms fade and a dump of the envelope capacitor, not a hard
#    stop: cutting a ringing tambourine dead puts a click on the front of
#    whatever cut it.
#
# ---- the preset rhythms ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The CR-78's own patterns, transcribed from pages 27-28 of the service notes.
# Four controls: the hardware controls plus a second selector that exposes its
# simultaneous-button rhythm combinations on Move's parameter page:
#
#   Rhythm 1  the first BUTTON, not a flattened pattern list. Seventeen of
#             them, exactly the seventeen on the panel.
#   Rhythm 2  Off or a second button. Off is the append-only default, so old
#             patches and the uncombined sound remain exactly as shipped.
#   A / B   the RHYTHM lever, and it does what the hardware's does.
#
# THE LEVER IS NOT A MEASURE SELECTOR, and getting that wrong is easy. Three
# of the CR-78's buttons carry TWO rhythms — they are printed "A-FOX TROT /
# B-TANGO", "A-MAMBO / B-CHA CHA", "A-BEGUINE / B-RHUMBA" — and the RHYTHM
# A/B lever on the right of the panel is what picks between them. On the
# fourteen single-label buttons it does nothing at all, exactly as on the
# hardware.
#
# That is also why the numbers work out: seventeen buttons, three of which
# are doubled by the lever, is twenty patterns. The score's own "A" and "B"
# bar marks are a different thing entirely — those are the two measures of
# each pattern, and they alternate on their own as the machine plays.
#
# Mode defaults to OFF, and that is load-bearing: with it off the module
# behaves exactly as it did before the rhythms existed, and nothing fires that
# the player did not ask for.
#
# Option text is sized for the stock grid's enum box (two lines of three
# characters), which is why the names are abbreviated the way they are. Order
# must match g_cr78_rhythms in cr78_rhythms.h; test/all.sh asserts it.

# string `name`; hierarchy entries spell it `label` — so a `label` on the
# hierarchy entry survives the merge AND wins the fallback. That is the seam:
# prefix `name` for the picker, keep `label` bare for the page.
#
# THE TAGS ARE THE MACHINE'S OWN ABBREVIATIONS, not the page ids uppercased.
#
# The CR-78's INSTRUMENTS SELECTOR rotary is engraved with them, and Behringer
# kept the same set on the RD-78's TRACK INSTRUMENT selector:
#
#     BD 1   SD 2   RS 3   CP 4   HH 5   CY 6   M 7
#     8 C/TB   9 HB/G   10 LB/MB   11 LC/CB   12 AC
#
# So the maracas are M, the claves are C and the guiro is G — one letter each,
# because that is what is printed on the panel. Deriving these from the page
# ids instead gives MA, CL and GU, which are perfectly readable and are not
# what the machine says. (CP is the clap, which the RD-78 adds and a CR-78
# does not have; AC is the accent, which lives on Master here.)
#
# The two send buses and the rhythm page are qualified the same way, and they
# have to be: Tone, HPF and Level exist on both buses, and Mode/Bank/Style
# would otherwise be bare.

# ---- Schwung 0.13's voices contract --------------------------------------
#
# Declare that this surface is a drum rack and which note each VOICE plays, so
# the host can lay out pads and follow the voice being edited without keeping a
# per-module table. Additive: a pre-0.13 host ignores all of it, and nothing
# about our own editor changes — it rides ui_pages, which ui_chain.js already
# feeds to the shared controller.
#
# KEYED BY LEVEL ID, NEVER BY POSITION. 9W9 lost four of eleven voices to a
# positional map, because its nav order, trigger enum and note numbers disagree
# about where the hats and cymbals sit. CW-78's three orders happen to agree —
# the enum is bd..mb, kLevelOf is the same, and the rack is 36+index with no
# transpositions — but "happens to agree today" is not a thing to build on, and
# a dict costs nothing.
#

# buses and Main get no note: a pad on any of them would play nothing. That is
# fourteen notes for fourteen voices, and the check asserts the count.
