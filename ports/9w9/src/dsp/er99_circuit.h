/*
 * er99_circuit.h — circuit-informed TR-909 voice models (BD / SD / toms).
 *
 * er-99's oscillator voices are "triangle + VCA envelope", which is why its
 * toms sound thin and its kick lacks attack. The real 909 analog voice is:
 *
 *   - an oscillator producing a TRIANGLE that is rounded toward a SINE by
 *     back-to-back diodes conducting ~0.5-0.6 V either side of ground,
 *   - a PITCH envelope: a pulse at note start runs the oscillator high, then
 *     it sweeps down to the frequency set by Tune,
 *   - an AMPLITUDE envelope (Decay),
 *   - and a separate CLICK path — a short impulse plus lowpass-filtered noise,
 *     summed and given their own fast envelope (the Attack control). This is
 *     the beater contact, and it is what er-99 is missing entirely.
 *
 * The snare adds a second tuned oscillator and a noise path with its own
 * envelope and highpass (Snappy).

 * lands on the hardware and the top of the pot goes past it, as a pot with
 * travel left should.
 *
 * The value is no longer eyeballed from three time points: 9W9's own snare is
 * rendered over a grid of settings and scored against the recording as a
 * ten-point trajectory (shell and noise band at 5/20/50/100/150 ms, in dB).
 * Best fit is 2.5 dB RMS, and it puts the noise where noon needs it.
 *
 * Re-fitted once the shell decay was corrected (tau 28 ms): the optimum moved
 * to 0.45 of the pot, so noon was about 10% hot. 1.95 puts the best fit back
 * at noon. For reference, Roland's own TR-909 plugin rendered from Gus's saved
 * preset is quieter still on the noise leg (0.12 against his hardware's 0.18
 * at 5 ms) — its Snappy was evidently set below noon, so the hardware stays
