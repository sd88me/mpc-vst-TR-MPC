/*
 * er99_perc909.h — circuit-informed TR-909 RIM SHOT and HAND CLAP.
 *
 * Replaces er-99's versions, which are not the target any more:
 *
 *  - er-99's rim is a single 220 Hz bandpass (its "parallel" topology only ever
 *    feeds filter 0 — the other two are wired to the output but nothing drives
 *    them), so it comes out dull and one-dimensional.
 *  - er-99's clap approximates the burst with five scheduled gain taps and no
 *    real delay line.
 *
 * The hardware:
 *
 *  RIM SHOT — a trigger pulse shock-excites a high-Q resonant network. Very
 *  short, and its character is the *pair* of resonances (a low "tock" body and
 *  a high "tick" edge) ringing together, plus a little noise for the transient.
 *
 *  HAND CLAP — one noise source through a bandpass, gated by TWO envelopes
 *  summed: a burst of three fast pulses roughly 10 ms apart (the "hands"), and
 *  a longer decaying tail (the room). That two-part structure is what makes a
 *  909 clap sound like a clap rather than a noise blip.
 *
 * Hats, ride and crash stay sampled — the real 909's cymbals are 6-bit PCM, so
 * sampling them is accurate, not a shortcut.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
