 * er99_tom909.h — the TR-909's tom voice, from the voicing-board schematic.
 *
 * The 909's toms are not one oscillator with a body. Each tom is THREE
 * oscillators, a noise path, and separate envelopes — that structure is why a
 * real 909 tom has weight and a bark, and why a single swept oscillator sounds
 * thin next to it.
 *
 * From the low tom on the service notes' voicing board (IC16, a 4069 UBP
 * hex inverter, supplies all three):
 *
 *   VCO1  timing cap C18  0.022 uF        R73  47K
 *   VCO2  timing cap C19  0.033 uF        R78  47K
 *   VCO3  timing cap C20  0.012 uF        R75  47K
 *
 * Same resistor on each, so the frequencies go as 1/C and the three sit at
 * fixed ratios: taking VCO2 (the lowest) as the fundamental,
 *
 *   VCO2 : VCO1 : VCO3  =  1 : 1.50 : 2.75
 *
 * Inharmonic on purpose — a drum head's modes are not a harmonic series, and
 * this stack is what gives the voice its pitched-but-not-musical character.
 * The hi tom uses 0.022 / 0.015 / 0.0082 uF, the same ratios an octave up, so
 * one set of ratios serves all three toms and the Tune control moves them
 * together.
 *
 * Each oscillator has its own VCA transistor and envelope (ENV1/ENV2/ENV3),
 * so the partials do NOT decay together. The envelope capacitors give the
 * rates: C23 0.68 uF through the Decay pot (VR11 500K) plus R111 56K is the
 * long one, 38 ms to 380 ms; C22 0.22 uF through R110 470K is fixed at about
 * 100 ms. So the upper partials die away while the fundamental is still
 * sounding, which is exactly what a struck drum does.
 *
 * Each oscillator's triangle passes through back-to-back diodes (D20/21,
 * D22/23, D28/27) that round it toward a sine, and the NOISE bus (R114, 22K)
 * adds the stick attack — visible as the spike marked "noise" at the head of
 * the low tom's scope trace in the service notes.
 *
 * Not modelled from component values: the exact CV-to-frequency law of the
 * starved-inverter oscillator, and the diodes' precise knee. Those are fitted.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
