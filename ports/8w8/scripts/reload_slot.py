"""Force a Schwung chain slot to reload its synth module.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Deploying a new dsp.so does not change what the device is
running. The chain host dlopen()s the plugin into the shim (inside
MoveOriginal); the atomic mv in deploy.sh swaps the directory entry while the
running process keeps the old inode mapped. `kill shadow_ui` does not help —
shadow_ui is a different process. Worse, an on-device loadtest dlopens the
file itself, so it passes against code nobody is hearing.

Re-writing the slot's module key makes the chain host unload the position and
dlopen a fresh instance: exactly what re-picking the synth in the UI does.

Standard library only (the Mac has no toolchain and no venv here).
