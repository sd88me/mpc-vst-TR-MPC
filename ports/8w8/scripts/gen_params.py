"""Single source of truth for 8W8's parameter surface.

Emits src/dsp/sc808_params.h, which carries THREE things that must never
drift apart:

  * chain_params   — types/ranges/options the Shadow UI needs (JSON)
  * ui_pages       — the page hierarchy (JSON; served under "ui_pages" so
                     ui_chain.js loads it, see the comment in ui_chain.js)
  * the pot table  — key -> real engineering range + curve + default

9W9 kept the pot table hand-written in a second header and it was a standing
drift hazard; 6W6 fixed that with this generator and 8W8 inherits it. Adding a
control is one edit here.

module.json is capped at 8 KB by Schwung's loader, so the JSON payloads are
served dynamically from the DSP via get_param().

# ---- Schwung's voices contract (pad_layout + per-voice note) ---------------
#
# Schwung 0.13 lets a module say that its surface is a drum rack and which MIDI
# note plays each voice, so the host lays out the pads and follows the voice
# you are editing without keeping a per-module table. Additive: a pre-0.13 host
# ignores it, and nothing about 8W8's own editor changes.
#
# KEYED BY LEVEL ID, never by position. Three orders exist in a kit like this
# — the nav list below, sc808_voice_t, and the note numbers — and in 9W9 no two
# of them agreed, so a positional map silently mislabelled its two hats and its
# two cymbals. 8W8's three DO agree, all sixteen of them, and the drum-rack map
# is a plain 36 + index. That is worth nothing as an assumption and something
# as an assertion: tools/voices_check.py proves it against the plugin's own
# routers rather than trusting this comment.
#
# src/dsp/sc808_plugin.cpp stays the authority — drumrack_to_voice() and the GM
# switch in note_to_voice(). If those change, change these with them; the check

# The knob grid draws a param under a page that already says COW BELL, so
# there it wants to read "Decay". Schwung's LFO and mod pickers draw one FLAT
# list across the whole module, where SIXTEEN voices each contribute a "Decay"
# and nothing says which pad you are about to automate. 8W8 has the worst of
# this in the family: 9W9 has eleven voices and 6W6 eight.
#
# param_meta.mjs merges the two sources as {...inlineHierarchy, ...chainParams}
# and resolves `meta.label || meta.name`. chain_params spells the display
# string `name`; hierarchy entries spell it `label` — so a `label` on the
# hierarchy entry survives the merge AND wins the fallback. That is the seam:
# prefix `name` for the picker, keep `label` bare for the page. Emitting
# `name` on the hierarchy entry instead is what makes the prefix leak onto the
# knob grid.
#
# The tags are the 808's own panel abbreviations, which is exactly the page id
# set uppercased — 9W9 had to hand-write its table because its keys carry a
# `_c_` infix, and ours do not. The two send buses qualify the same way, and
# they have to: Tone, HPF and Level exist on both of them, and the assertion
# below caught exactly that the moment the pages were added.
