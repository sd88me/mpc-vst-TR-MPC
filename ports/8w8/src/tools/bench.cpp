/*
 * bench.cpp — the CPU gate. Cross-compiled and run ON the Move.
 *
 * 6W6's three metal voices summed 141 sines per sample and took 55% of the
 * device's block budget before they were rewritten. 8W8's arithmetic is
 * cheaper per voice — naive pulses and biquads rather than partial sums — but
 * there are sixteen lanes instead of eight and the cymbal alone runs eighteen
 * biquads through three parallel chains. That is worth measuring on the
 * hardware rather than assuming, which is what this is for.
 *
 * Reports the realtime factor and, more usefully, the share of one core. The
 * number to compare against is 6W6, which shipped at 22% of a core after its
 * metal voices were rewritten (they started at 55%). A module shares the
 * device with everything else in the chain, so a third of a core is the point
 * at which this needs work.
 *
 * MEASURED ON THE MOVE, 2026-08-23, first build:
 *   worst single lane   cymbal, 39.7x realtime (2.5% of a core)
 *   all 16 every 16th   (see docs/DESIGN.md for the measured figure)
 *   busy pattern        see below
 * The "all 16" case is pathological — every voice retriggered 9.3 times a
 * second — and is here as a ceiling, not as a target.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
