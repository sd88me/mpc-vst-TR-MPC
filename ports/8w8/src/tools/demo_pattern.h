/*
 * demo_pattern.h — two bars of 8W8, as data.
 *
 * Shared by src/tools/render.cpp, which writes it out so the kit can be
 * heard, and tools/kit_check.cpp, which fits the kit's absolute level to it.
 *
 * Those two wanting the same pattern is not a convenience. The level has to
 * be fitted to what a pattern ACTUALLY peaks at, and every cheaper proxy for
 * that has been wrong in turn: a four-voice downbeat left this pattern
 * clipping at +0.7 dBFS, and a six-voice full-velocity hit — which no pattern ever
 * produces — left it 8.6 dB quieter than it needed to be. Fit the thing you
 * are going to listen to.
 *
 * Deliberately plain: a normal 808 pattern, not a showcase. A pattern that
 * avoided the awkward simultaneous hits would not answer the question.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
