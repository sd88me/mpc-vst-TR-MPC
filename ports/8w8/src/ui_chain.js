/*
 * 8W8 ui_chain.js — a thin binding over Schwung's shared param_pages library
 * (host 0.12.1+), keeping every gesture the stock hierarchy editor does not
 * have. Ported from 6W6 with an 808 roster: the three kits must feel
 * identical under the hands, so the gestures, the hint and the focus gate are
 * the same code with different tables.
 *
 * 8W8 fills the pad block where 6W6 half-filled it — SIXTEEN drums, one per
 * sc808 SynthDef — so the tables below are the only real difference, plus a
 * mute mask that needs sixteen bits rather than eight. There is no Master pad
 * to handle, because there is no pad left for it.
 *
 * Division of labour:
 *   param_pages (stock)          this file (8W8)
 *   ------------------          ---------------------------------
 *   knob grid, dial layout      pads pass through to Move + page-follow
 *   viz graphics (faders...)    Shift+Pad silent select (white pad follows)
 *   jog page / Shift+Jog        Mute+Pad per-lane 8W8 mutes
 *   section picker (jog click)  focus gate (never steal another slot's pads)
 *   hold-knob name strip        pad_block lifecycle + self-heal
 *   Shift reveal + fine mode
 *   Mute+knob reset-to-default
 *
 * Why this file still exists at all: the host's enterComponentEdit prefers a
 * module's ui_hierarchy and would never load ui_chain.js if we served one — so
 * the DSP serves the hierarchy under "ui_pages" instead, and the injected
 * getParam below rewrites the controller's "ui_hierarchy" read to it. Pads are
 * not part of the stock grid's input model, so pad behaviour stays ours.
