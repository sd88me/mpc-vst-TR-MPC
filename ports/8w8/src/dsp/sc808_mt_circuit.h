/*
 * sc808_mt_circuit.h — the TR-808 metal voices, from the circuit.
 *
 * One file because it is one circuit: the 808 generates its cowbell, cymbal,
 * open hat and closed hat from a SINGLE bank of six Schmitt-trigger square
 * oscillators (half of one HD14584), and the four voices are four different
 * ways of filtering and enveloping that bank. Werner, Abel and Smith's ICMC
 * 2014 paper analyses the cymbal end to end; the hi-hat side is read off the
 * service schematics (Q26..Q31 on the voicing board); the cowbell reuses
 * oscillators 5 and 6 exactly as the hardware does.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED, AND FROM WHERE
 *
 *   Oscillator bank — Werner §3: nominal 205.3, 369.6, 304.4, 522.7 Hz,
 *   plus 800 and 540 on internal trimpots TM1/TM2. Duty cycle 47.98% and
 *   amplitude 5 V from the HD14584's thresholds. FREE-RUNNING: the bank
 *   never stops on the hardware, so no two hits are the same. All four
 *   voices read the SAME bank, which is why an 808's cymbal and hats sit
 *   together the way they do.
 *
 *   Band pass filters — Werner §4, the paper's H(s) by bilinear transform,
 *   coefficients from component values (R56 56k, R57 82k; C 6.8n pairs
 *   for BP1, 3.3n for BP2). The input impedance is the mixer's ~1k bus,
 *   solved exactly so the response peaks at the paper's stated centres:
 *   3445 Hz and 7101 Hz.
 *
 *   Hi-hat filter ladders — service schematic: the bank couples to each
 *   hat's VCA through a two-section C-R high-pass, 1.5 nF sections for the
 *   OPEN hat (C64/C65/C66/C68 with R147 2.7k, R146 68k) and 1.0 nF for the
 *   CLOSED (C69/C70/C72/C73, R153 2.7k, R155 68k) — the closed hat is
 *   high-passed HIGHER than the open, which is most of why it is the
 *   thinner, tickier voice. Output stage: inverting amp, gain R159/R160 =
 *   470k/39k = 12 with 220 pF across the feedback (1.54 kHz corner).
 *
 *   Envelope times — the OPEN hat's decay is VR (2M) against C62 0.47 uF
 *   (up to ~1 s); the CLOSED hat has no decay control: R173 330k into C63
 *   0.47 uF, with the diode gate cutting the tail. The cymbal's three
 *   envelopes are Werner §7/Fig 7: a fast tall crash (EG3), a mid body
 *   (EG2), and the pot-controlled sustain (EG1) whose release runs through
 *   VR2 — the panel's CY Decay.
 *
 *   Swing VCAs — Werner §8: half-wave conduction scaled by the envelope,
 *   with the DIODE GATE that shuts the voice completely once the envelope
 *   falls below the diode's forward drop (V_on = 0.5899 V) — the abrupt
 *   little death at the end of an 808 hat tail is that diode.
 *
 *   Sallen-Key high passes — Werner §9: HP1 2nd order from R124/R127 22k/82k
 *   with 1.5 n (2.50 kHz, Q 0.97); HP2 2nd order non-unity gain; HP3 3rd
 *   order with the resonance near 10.5 kHz the paper calls out. HP3's peak
 *   is where the cymbal's sizzle lives.
 *
 * WHAT IS FITTED, AND AGAINST WHAT
 *
 *   Envelope time constants and band levels are fitted against Roland's own
 *   TR-808 plugin rendered offline at the default kit (the same reference
 *   the toms were corrected against) and against hardware sample decays:
 *   CH to 1% of peak in 85 ms, OH 0.40 s, CY 1.79 s, CB 0.43 s. Each
 *   fitted constant says so beside its value. tools/mt_check asserts the
 *   lot.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
