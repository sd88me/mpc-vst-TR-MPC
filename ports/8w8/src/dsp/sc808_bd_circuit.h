/*
 * sc808_bd_circuit.h — the TR-808 bass drum, as a circuit.
 *
 * This is the voice 8W8 exists for. Everything else in the kit can be a
 * faithful transcription of sc808 and be fine; the kick cannot, because
 * sc808's kick is a sine on a pitch envelope and an 808's kick is not.
 *
 * WHAT AN 808 KICK ACTUALLY IS
 *
 * A bridged-T network sitting in the negative feedback path of an op-amp.
 * That arrangement is a resonator, and it is kicked by a ~1 ms pulse from the
 * trigger. Left alone it would ring for about 100 ms. What makes the long
 * 808 boom is a second path: the output goes through a feedback buffer whose
 * gain is the DECAY POTENTIOMETER and comes back into the network. Decay is
 * not an envelope on this circuit — it is loop gain, and the note lasts as
 * long as the loop takes to lose it. Turn it up and the thing edges toward
 * self-oscillation.
 *
 * That single fact is why an 808 kick behaves the way it does and why an
 * envelope-based imitation never quite does:
 *
 *   - the pitch SIGHS downward through the note instead of holding, because
 *     leakage current shifts the network's effective resistance as the note
 *     decays
 *   - the ATTACK is a real jump in the resonator's centre frequency and Q for
 *     a few milliseconds, not a second oscillator layered on top
 *   - retriggering before the previous note has died does NOT machine-gun,
 *     because the filter state is still there and the new pulse adds to it
 *   - accent changes the sound and not only the level, because the trigger
 *     voltage drives a diode whose behaviour is not linear in it
 *
 * PROVENANCE, and what is and is not taken from the paper
 *
 * Kurt James Werner, Jonathan Abel and Julius Smith, "A Physically-Informed,
 * Circuit-Bendable, Digital Model of the Roland TR-808 Bass Drum Circuit",
 * DAFx-14. The block decomposition, the identification of what each block
 * does, the pulse shaper's shelf-plus-diode form, the decay pot as loop gain,
 * the attack-time frequency shift and the leakage pitch sigh are all theirs.
 *
 * The coefficients here are RE-DERIVED rather than transcribed, deliberately.
 * The paper's published coefficient list for the bridged-T in feedback is
 * dimensionally inconsistent as printed (its s^2 and s^0 terms differ by an
 * ohm), and the component values legible in the schematic figure give a
 * centre frequency of 100 Hz where the text states 49.5 Hz. Rather than ship
 * numbers that cannot be checked, this file works from the STATED BEHAVIOUR —
 * centre frequency, Q, the attack shift, the sigh's depth and time constant,
 * the decay range — and derives the resonator from those. Every such choice
 * is marked and its source given.
 *
 * That distinction matters: this is a physically-informed model built to a
 * published analysis, not a transcription, and unlike Engine A it has no null
 * test behind it. It is checked against the paper's own figures — the
 * instantaneous-frequency trace and the retrigger test — by tools/bd_check.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
