 * that a set of SynthDefs does not have: pot mapping, per-voice drive and
 * distortion, velocity, hi-hat choke, per-lane mutes and the master stage.
 *
 * Realtime contract: every entry point here runs on the SPI callback. Nothing
 * below allocates, opens a file or takes a lock after sc808_create().

/*
 * Lane order. This is the pad order, the state blob order and the mute-bit
 * order, and changing it breaks saved patches.
 *
 * SIXTEEN voices fill Move's left 4x4 pad block exactly:
 *
 *     row 3 (92-95)   CB  CH  OH  CY
 *     row 2 (84-87)   RS  CL  MA  CP
 *     row 1 (76-79)   HT  LC  MC  HC
 *     row 0 (68-71)   BD  SD  LT  MT
 *
 * The rim shot and the claves have a pad each. They share one CHANNEL on the
 * hardware — the 808's panel has a single RS/CL selector and a pattern cannot
 * contain both — and 8W8 ran them as one lane with a mode switch for exactly
 * that reason. Splitting them is a deliberate departure: sc808 ships them as
 * two SynthDefs, a pattern that wants both is a normal thing to want, and it
 * makes the roster sixteen, which is what the pad block holds.
 *
 * The cost is the Master pad. With sixteen drums there is no sixteenth pad
 * left for it, so Master is reached by the jog — click for the section list,
 * or Shift+Jog — as every other page is. 9W9 and 6W6 keep pad 16 for Master;
 * this one cannot.
