/*
 * sc808_voices.h — Engine A: sc808.scd, voice by voice, in C++.
 *
 * Each class below is one SynthDef from src/vendor/sc808/sc808.scd, kept in
 * the same order and using the same variable names as the original so the two
 * can be read side by side. Where sc808 does something surprising, the
 * comment says what and why it was NOT "fixed" — this is a transcription, and
 * a transcription that improves things does not null against SuperCollider.
 *
 * The knobs are ours. sc808 exposes MIDI-note and second arguments; 8W8
 * exposes 0-127 pots and maps them onto those arguments in sc808_engine.cpp.
 * Every trigger() below takes engineering values, already mapped.
 *
 * One structural difference from SC, and it is deliberate: SC creates a new
 * synth per note, so every note starts with fresh filter state. These voices
 * are persistent and DO NOT clear filter state on trigger. That is what stops
 * fast repeats from clicking, and it is what real hardware does — a filter
 * does not forget because you hit the pad again.
 *
 * sc808.scd is MIT (Sonic Pi, etc/synthdefs); 8W8 is GPL-3.0.

/*
 * sonic-pi-sc808_bassdrum.
 *
 * Two sines and a triangle on a shared pitch envelope that falls from 7x the
 * note to 1.35x to the note. The "punch" is a second sine on a marginally
 * faster envelope, highpassed at 350 Hz — the click you hear is the top of
 * that sweep before it drops out of the passband.
 *
 * THE LIMITER. sc808 ends with Limiter.ar(sig, 0.5), and SC's Limiter is a
 * lookahead design: it delays by two buffers, 20 ms at its default, and it is
 * doing about 23 dB of gain reduction on the way through.
 *
 * In SuperCollider each drum is its own synth and nobody notices either. In a
 * drum machine both are unacceptable — a kick 20 ms behind the snare is not a
 * kick, and squashing the first 100 ms flattens exactly the attack and decay
 * that make one.
 *
 * So the limiter is REPRODUCED (the null test needs it, and it is what sc808
 * sounds like) but the engine switches it off with setLimiter(false). With it
 * off the voice emits the raw sum and the engine's own per-voice Drive stage
 * catches the peaks — which is the stage that exists for exactly that, and
 * unlike the limiter it is under a knob.
 *
 * Bypassing it needs a fixed gain in its place, or the voice comes out 18 dB
 * hot and clips: measured on the default kick, the limiter is holding a peak
 * of 7.945 down to 1.0 while only pulling the RMS from 0.80 to 0.31. That
 * spread is the point — it is squashing an 8:1 transient, and that transient
 * is the beater. Replacing 18 dB of dynamic gain reduction with 18 dB of
 * static gain hands the transient back.

/* ---- hand clap -------------------------------------------------------- */

/*
 * sonic-pi-sc808_clap.
 *
 * Not the hardware's clap. A real 808 fires three fast noise bursts about
 * 10 ms apart before the tail; sc808 uses one immediate burst plus a second
 * one delayed 26 ms, then a long diffuse "reverb" of quiet noise. It reads as
 * a clap and it is what we are transcribing, but it is the voice with the
 * most daylight between sc808 and an 808, and the first candidate for
 * Engine B.
 *
 * Two sc808 quirks preserved: `amp` scales only the delayed burst and the
 * tail, never the attack burst; and the SynthDef reuses the name `decay` for
 * a signal after using it as a time, so the tail's length ends up read off an
 * audio-rate value. We use the nominal 4 s + decay and note that the clap is
 * expected to null only approximately.
