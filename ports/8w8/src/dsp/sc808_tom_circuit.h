/*
 * sc808_tom_circuit.h — the TR-808 tom / conga channel, from the circuit.
 *
 * Engine B for all six tom and conga lanes. sc808's transcription stays
 * exactly as it is and keeps its place in the null test; this runs alongside
 * it and the panel switches.
 *
 * SECOND VERSION, and the first one is worth an honest paragraph. It guessed
 * where it had no data: a 33% pitch lift, a loud white-noise "skin" on the
 * toms, and a conga that was the drier, shorter one. Then reference arrived —
 * hardware samples with note names in the filenames, and Roland's own plugin
 * to render — and measurement said otherwise on every count:
 *
 *   TUNING (measured fundamentals, settled):
 *     tom    F2 87.3      C3 130.8     G3 196.0     — seven semitones apart
 *     conga  G3 196.0     D4 293.7     A4 440.0     — seven semitones apart
 *   The congas sit more than an OCTAVE above their toms. The old defaults
 *   (played 164.8 / 220 / 293.7 as toms at 82/104/165) were both mistuned
 *   and wrongly spaced, which is why the lanes "did not overlap".
 *
 *   PITCH DROP: low tom 94.8 -> 87.7 Hz (+8.6% at onset), hi tom +2.3%,
 *   congas under +1%. The old 33% was a caricature.
 *
 *   NOISE: the low tom sample has 99.9% of its energy below 400 Hz. The
 *   noise head is a texture on the strike, not a layer you hear as noise —
 *   the old 0.75 white-noise skin was reported, accurately, as hiss.
 *
 *   DECAY (to 1% of peak): toms 0.39 / 0.23 / 0.18 s, congas 0.36 / 0.16 /
 *   0.145 s. At the SAME pitch the conga rings TWICE as long as the tom
 *   (G3: 0.36 vs 0.18) — the first version had that exactly backwards.
 *
 * WHAT THE SWITCH IS, then, as measured: the tom position damps the ring and
 * dirties the strike (the noise path and 1.5k are in circuit); the conga
 * position is the cleaner, longer-ringing, higher-tuned one. The samples'
 * conga peaks arrive at 2-5 ms (resonance building); the toms' inside 1 ms
 * (struck, with the head).
 *
 * STILL FROM THE SCHEMATIC, unchanged: the bridged-T with Q = 10.82 from
 * R218/R219 = 2.2M/4.7k, the loop (decay as loop gain), the pulse shaper,
 * the op-amp clip.
 *
 * THE DECAY POT IS SECONDS. The knob maps to ring time (to 1% of peak) and
 * the circuit solves the loop gain that produces it at the current pitch:
 *
 *     g = 1 - ln(100) * Q / (pi * f0 * t)
 *
 * so the knob keeps its meaning when Tune moves — the same seconds at any
 * pitch — and both engines on the lane can share one number. Clamped at
 * g >= 0: below natural ring (Q alone) the network cannot be pushed shorter.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
