/*
 * sd606_cymbal.h — the voice the upstream repo does not ship.
 *
 * The real TR-606's roster is BD, SD, Low Tom, Hi Tom, CYMBAL, Open HH,
 * Closed HH. 606-Inspired-Synth-Drums covers six of those and adds an RD-6
 * clap, but there is no cymbal in it. This supplies one.
 *
 * On the hardware the cymbal and the hi-hats are the SAME metal source — one
 * oscillator bank split by different envelopes and filters — so the honest way
 * to build a cymbal here is a third HiHatSpec, not a new engine.
 * MetalHiHatVoice takes any spec; nothing in the vendored code changes.
 *
 * MEASURED from hardware. Source: "Cymbal 606 Clean.wav" — the UN-ACCENTED
 * hit, 44.1 kHz 24-bit, crest 18.6 dB. The accented take was rejected as a
 * fitting source: accent drives the voice harder, so any distortion it adds
 * would be baked into this table as if it were a resonance of the instrument.
 * A fit wants the cleanest capture of the circuit, not the loudest.
 *
 * The fit reaches down to 266 Hz. That matters: the vendored hat table stops
 * at 3804 Hz because it was measured off a HI-HAT, and a cymbal's body lives
 * below that. Re-voicing the hat table could never have produced it.
 *
 * 32 lines, not the 64 the fit produces. Partial count is this engine's
 * dominant CPU cost — one sin() per line per sample — and a measured sweep
 * against this same recording found quality FLAT from 64 down to 24
 * (spectral 3.77 -> 4.00 dB/band) and only breaking at 16. 32 takes half the
 * CPU with margin over the knee. Re-run the sweep before changing it:
 *   ./cymbal_tune "Cymbal 606 Clean.wav" --partials N
 *
 * Partials and envelope come from tools/fit_partials.py — FFTs at six points
 * through the decay, keeping the lines that survive it, which is the method
 * Fecher describes for the hats. The voicing fields come from
 * tools/cymbal_tune.cpp, which renders the voice and scores it against the
 * recording. Both are re-runnable; neither is a taste judgement.
 *
 * GPL-3.0.
