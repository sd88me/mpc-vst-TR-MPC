"""Single source of truth for 6W6's parameter surface.

Emits src/dsp/sd606_params.h, which carries THREE things that must never drift
apart:

  * chain_params   — types/ranges/options the Shadow UI needs (JSON)
  * ui_pages       — the page hierarchy (JSON; served under "ui_pages" so
                     ui_chain.js loads, see the comment in ui_chain.js)
  * the pot table  — key -> real engineering range + curve + default

9W9 kept the pot table hand-written in a second header and it was a standing
drift hazard. Here one Python dict generates all three, so adding a control is
one edit and the loadtest's key list is derived from the same source.

module.json is capped at 8 KB by Schwung's loader, so the JSON payloads are
served dynamically from the DSP via get_param().
